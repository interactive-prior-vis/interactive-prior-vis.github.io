For both, I selected t-distribution over Gaussian, because t-distributions have less heavy tails relative to Gaussians, allowing for a softer control over the parameters.","if the sample size is small, the prior will have a relatively large impact; as the sample size increases, the impact of prior will be reduced.","Doctorate","t(4,1)","t(0,1)","0c",NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
